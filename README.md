## Description

A terminal based application that allows a user to add information about the members of their project team. The program first asks for the information about the Project Manager and then prompts the user if they would like to add an additional team member, or finish running the application once they're done adding team members. The collected information is then compiled into an HTML file that displays the saved information about each team member and their role.
